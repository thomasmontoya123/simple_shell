.SH "NAME"
hsh - Holberton's Simple sHell
.br
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhsh\fR [<\fIfilename\fR>]
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Holberton's simple shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
.br

This program acts as a bridge between the user and the system, making it possible to convert the orders that are introduced, into actions performed by the computer, either through human intervention in interactive mode, the execution of a command through a pipe, or the loading of a file containing the orders that the system must execute.
.br

.SS "INVOCATION"
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently.
.br

When the first argument consists of a file, the program proceeds to perform the sequential execution line by line, taking into account that it will first search for the identifier that points to the file as suitable for the execution of the instructions (shebang).
.br
.SS "SIGNAL HANDLING"
\fBhsh\fR disables the operation of the SIGINT and Ctrl+C key combination.
.br
.SH "OPTIONS"
Actually this program has no options available. 
.br
.SH "BUILT-INS"
\fBhsh\fR has 4 builtins embedded:
.br

		\fBcd\fR		Change directory option. Operation without parameters or special symbols are allowed
.br
		
.br
		\fBhelp\fR	Shows help pages. The user can type the builtin as parameter and ask for help about details
.br
				related to the builtin
.br
		
.br
		\fBenv\fR		Prints the environment
.br
		
.br
		\fBexit\fR	Exits the shell. The user can write a positive number as parameter to throw as a return value
.br
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
In normal operation, \fBhsh\fR should finish its runtime with a zero value. That indicates successful operation.
.br

Errors related with memory allocation should exit with -1 and the corresponding errno value:
.br

		\fBENOMEM\fR		Out of memory
.br
		
.br
Failures on built-ins should return -1, showing abnormal operation.
.br
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To run this program in interactive mode:
.br

\fB./hsh\fR
.br

A prompt symbol shows the program is ready to receive commands:
.br

\fB($)\fR
.br

The user can write commands with or without arguments, and the shell runs that after press the ENTER key.
.br

\fB($) uname
.br
Linux\fR
.br

The shell can receive data using standard Unix pipes.
.br

\fB$ echo "uname" | hsh
.br
Linux\fR
